Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, standards, runtimes.
Java is great choice for building modern, scalable, robust software. in today's data-oriented, cloud-first, cost-sensitive world, java looks mature,slow, resource-intensive.

Quarkus changes this perception, offering fast, lightweight, flexible java framework perfect for java enterprise applications. 


BPOA ( Build Process Oriented Architecture) - focuses on designing systems around flow of business processes rather than just individual components or services.

Quarkus's BPOA results in smaller and faster runnable artifacts, perfect for designs like microservices, serverless apps, cli apps, edge, github actions, kubernetes operators.


where and how quarkus can be a good fit for next projects?

java is originally created for long running apps. in cloud environment, app startup time, memory/cpu usage are important metrics. Long starts and high memory usage of java apps are not acceptable as processing related into cloud costs.

Quarkus was designed to address these challanges.

java has to do lot of processing once application starts
- reading and processing app code
- annotations
- configuration
- inversion of control
- generating dynamic code to initialize the app within framework properly.

quarkus moves much of the application processing to build time phase (aplication build /packaging) . to save resource at run-time. Packages application carriers the reults of initial framework operations. this makes package faster to start and smaller in size because the code needed only in init phase is never included in final packaged artifact.

quarkus provides dev-mode (live reload of code change and config change).

Quarkus - kubernetes native java stack tailored for openJDK hotspot and graalVM.

k8s native - tools and framework targeting k8s as target deployment platform.

Reactive programming utilizes asynchronous data streams. Quarkus has good support for imperative and reactive programming. Quarkus has reactive engine, it doesnot force to use reactive programming model. 

in JDK21 virtual threads aims to solve complexity of reactive programming. quarkus supports executing user program in virtual threads. quarkus allows easy switching between blocking, reactive and virtual threads.
