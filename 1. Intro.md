Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, standards, runtimes.
Java is great choice for building modern, scalable, robust software. in today's data-oriented, cloud-first, cost-sensitive world, java looks mature,slow, resource-intensive.

Quarkus changes this perception, offering fast, lightweight, flexible java framework perfect for java enterprise applications. 


BPOA ( Build Process Oriented Architecture) - focuses on designing systems around flow of business processes rather than just individual components or services.

Quarkus's BPOA results in smaller and faster runnable artifacts, perfect for designs like microservices, serverless apps, cli apps, edge, github actions, kubernetes operators.


where and how quarkus can be a good fit for next projects?

java is originally created for long running apps. in cloud environment, app startup time, memory/cpu usage are important metrics. Long starts and high memory usage of java apps are not acceptable as processing related into cloud costs.

Quarkus was designed to address these challanges.

java has to do lot of processing once application starts
- reading and processing app code
- annotations
- configuration
- inversion of control
- generating dynamic code to initialize the app within framework properly.

quarkus moves much of the application processing to build time phase (aplication build /packaging) . to save resource at run-time. Packages application carriers the reults of initial framework operations. this makes package faster to start and smaller in size because the code needed only in init phase is never included in final packaged artifact.

quarkus provides dev-mode (live reload of code change and config change).

Quarkus - kubernetes native java stack tailored for openJDK hotspot and graalVM.

k8s native - tools and framework targeting k8s as target deployment platform.

Reactive programming utilizes asynchronous data streams. Quarkus has good support for imperative and reactive programming. Quarkus has reactive engine, it doesnot force to use reactive programming model. 

in JDK21 virtual threads aims to solve complexity of reactive programming. quarkus supports executing user program in virtual threads. quarkus allows easy switching between blocking, reactive and virtual threads.

Jandex - Java annotation indexer.

Jandex library is used to index annotations, class metadata efficiently. Jandex creates compact index of annotations, class structure, fields and methods, interfaces and inheritance. This index allows frameworks to quickly access metadata without loading classes into memory which improves startup time and performance.

Gizmo library used by quarkus build tools to generate bytecode during build time. Gizmo produces code needed by ARC - the DI framework of Quarkus. ARC implements CDI specification, but all the dependency resolution and wiring happens at compile time. 

Graal SDK is set of java libraries and APIs provided by GraalVM that enables developers to build and run polyglot apps, custom languages, native images. custom languages or interpreter can be built using truffle framework

The extensions are pluggable pieces of functionality that can extend either build-time or run-time features of quarkus. extensions cover integration, automation, security ...etc. Using extensions has direct impact on application size and processing speed. 

you can run quarkus on any standard JVM (Open JDK, Oracle JDK, Amazon Corretto, Eclipse Temurin). This is called JVM mode. 

GRAAL VM is optional but powerful. if you want to compile quarkus app into native executable then graalVM is required. This is called native mode and it offers
- Fast startup time
- Lower memory usage
- Smaller container images
- Better performance for microservices and serverless

To build a native image, Quarkus uses Graal VM's native-image tool during the build process.
