Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, standards, runtimes.
Java is great choice for building modern, scalable, robust software. in today's data-oriented, cloud-first, cost-sensitive world, java looks mature,slow, resource-intensive.

Quarkus changes this perception, offering fast, lightweight, flexible java framework perfect for java enterprise applications. 


BPOA ( Build Process Oriented Architecture) - focuses on designing systems around flow of business processes rather than just individual components or services.

Quarkus's BPOA results in smaller and faster runnable artifacts, perfect for designs like microservices, serverless apps, cli apps, edge, github actions, kubernetes operators.


where and how quarkus can be a good fit for next projects?
