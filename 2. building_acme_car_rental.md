By analyzing how customer utilizes the systenm we can differentiate two usecase
- user management ( user login, registeration options provided by Users service)
- reservation making ( user has to login into the system to make reservations)

  reservation service provides cars received from inventory service after filtering the available cars for the customer at customer-selected time period.  if user decides to make the reservation, then the reservation service calls the Billing service to proceed with payment.

since renting a car requires interaction with employee to verify validity of reservation, employess must have access to the system. An employee can also perform fleet management. Employee can register and remove vehicles through inventory service. Employees can perform bookings which is a multi-step process. 

The previous section identified core actors, use cases and potential services. in a microservice architecture, each application should be an independent service and uses decentralized data store. microservices can communicate using multiple channels like rest, graphQL, gRPC, RabbitMQ, Kakfa.
